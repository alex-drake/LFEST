# LFEST
Work for the Freight Compliance Unit to automate their periodic data processing and display the data in a user friendly dashboard.

This work has helped to familiarise myself with the world of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Note that the raw data has not been provided due to its sensitive nature.

## CSS
I have taken advantage of [bootstrap](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/), [mdbootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) and developed custom css where necessary.

## JavaScript
Other than the libraries required for Bootstrap/MDBootstrap, I have predominantly used [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to manipulate the HTML with the aim to go further and create some great visualisations (as shown in the D3.js [examples](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)). 

Table control is granted using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and queue.js is used during the data import phase.

[Melt.js](https://github.com/jrideout/melt.js/blob/master/README.md) has been used to manipulate/flatten the data.

## HTML
HTML for the dashboard is shown in *index.html*. Note that the page will not function properly as the data to populate the initial table has not been provided.
